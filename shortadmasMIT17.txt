So, today's task is going to be to outline some of the basic experimental facts that we will both have to deal with and that we are in should be to understand and be model through the rest of the course. So, it doesn't tell you some abstract truth about why the universe is the way it is. So, it gives you a lot of wisdom to understand how things work and predict what will happen in acting and what we will be aiming to do is develop models that give us the intuition for the phenomena and allow me to make predictions. And these are going to be the experimental facts that we would like to both explain, develop an intuition for it to be able to predict consequences of it. So, we'll start off with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of We'll start off with, so we just outline them. So first fact, how does it exist? I'll go over some of the arguments for that. Randomness definitely presents in the world. I'm expecter artistry and structure. We have a photoelectric effect, which I'll describe in some detail. Electro-inducing funny things in particular electron diffraction and 6 and finally, skeleton equality, something that we will come back to at the very end of the class.
