 So I started how I am already. So how do I see? I don't know. It depends on how cool it is. So in theory What is safe? Yeah, is that what you're saying? Come and say something. Wait, what is your easy recording? Hmm? This saves. What is this? Oh wait, this is what you just said. No, what was you said? No. What is it? So how do I stop it then? That's the thing. Cohen doesn't have a way to stop his program from earning. So until he sets the and what happens is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7 Sometimes it hallucinates This isn't very accurate. Yeah, that's a hallucination So I just show this transcript around this page. to do with it. You have that information so you should do it. Well, it's like we've got to be harder to do because you're doing writing in a separate program so you'd have to capture the output of the program and do it. within the code, right? But his code is not set up to run inside your code. Okay. You don't make into a class or a function. Yeah. So he's so cool. into the AI text. So that will save it as a file and then you open that file and you know you're But I should get like after five minutes from this is done. Yes. Okay. Now questions I don't know if it saves it as goes on so actually do this. Okay, so this is just the file itself right is not addressing it as a server to delete all that okay, two zero Okay, yeah, go to this. Yeah, go to that one. So that's the main trace from the server. Oh, it entered. Okay. Well, yeah, but if he'd saved it, like if he was saving it as he was going I'm going to do one of these things you could save it, then back it to up here. I don't know if that is the same as the same email report, I'm going to record save. So what files is saving to the same file or is it saving in the right directory? and that's before he makes the transfer. In case he saves the sound file and then he converts that to text. do you think? Hasn't has him saved to that? Yeah okay now we can check though because you're running out every Now every three. Yeah, where's it save it to? Now there's a challenge groups. text. Okay, open text. Oh, oh, T is equal to that right. So it opens Okay, so he's writing a file text.txt every time. Oh, so when it's done, it writes out the text file to text.txt. When does he save it to? What was his file? His name is saving it out? What? He's ultimately saving. What's the file that you open? AI text. Yeah, see if you see that anywhere in here. Okay, that's what you will
