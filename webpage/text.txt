 And we're doing hugging face for the song right? Okay, so it's probably, yeah, since the starting is probably recording right now. Um, give me a sentence, I could just shut my mouth. What do you think about lasagna? I think lasagna is very good. Okay, I think it's good too. I like the texture. You know, tomato, tomato, potato, potato. Do you think you'd have so much trouble with other students if you had less of living in the classroom. I think that's racism. Everybody should celebrate. I think I think that's just like stereo, stereo type because a lot of people in the United States that the ancient food smells so the things bad but in our culture it smells actually pretty good but I as a I smell both. So yeah, I don't know. Now we can keep doing this in five minutes. Can you just can you stop it? No, you can't because there's no way to set it up. It's a bit row-c. And you can't even do the server. You can change it so it's not. Yeah, it has around a specific time. There's no button that can press the focus lock. Come on, wait a minute. That was not our door. I would be so hard on that. It's not going up, honey. Nothing's good enough for him. Every single day. every single day. How long has been going for? What are the numbers? How long has it been going for? What about the numbers? We're off. Recording is it? I mean, that's trans trans. Yeah, I don't know. Each one you do? Oh, done. Look at that. Is it done? Well, I see the recording saved. It says that strands, trans. I don't think it's done. Nope, it's not done. So what's this? Is this like after? Starting off numbers, starting over again. What is this? It's recording saved. Game. Are we and we're going moving hugging fish this song right? Oh, this is like all of it. So it's been a minute. I'm pretty sure it's been longer than a minute. every two minutes of each summit. So is this going for a format? No, just to begin with, many of you have to raise the up meantime before we go. Why should we have stood in front of you? What are you watching? Come on, we was like an AI voice. Yeah, I know. Moving my audio with me. Who's that? Actually I do these pictures. See video. Hmm.
